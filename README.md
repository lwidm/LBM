# Lattice Boltzmann Method Simulation Project

## Overview

Welcome to my Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM) Simulation Project! This project is a framework for simulating fluid dynamics using the Lattice Boltzmann Method. The project is divided into two main components:

1. **C++ Program:** The core of the simulation, handling the main computational task.
2. **Python Program (post_processing.py):** Used for post-processing the simulation data generated by the C++ program.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design:** _Feature not yet implemented_: Create custom simulations by connecting various functions (initial conditions, boundary conditions, exit conditions, solver types) in a specific way using C++ code. This modular approach also allows for advanced tasks, such as running multiple simulations sequentially and performing error convergence studies.
- **Simulation dimensions:** _Feature not yet implemented_: Choose between 1D, 2D, and 3D simulations.
- **Solver types:**
  - _Feature not yet implemented_: LBM
  - _Feature not yet implemented_: KBC
  - _Feature not yet implemented_: LBM_exact_difference
- **Analytical solutions / initial conditions:**
  - 2D Poisseuille flow with constant Fx (force)
  - _Feature not yet implemented_: 2D and 3D Taylor Green
- **High performance:** Efficient (I hope, just a mechanical engineer here ;) ) c++ code for computations.
- **Versatile post-processing:** Python script to visualize simulation results.

## Main Functions

### C++ Functions

Currently, there are two main functions in the C++ codebase that users should modify according to their requirements:

- **`main()`:** The entry point of the simulation program.
- **`initial_condition()`:** Defines the initial conditions for the simulation.

### Missing Functions

The following functions are not yet implemented and need to be completed by the user:

- **`boundary_condition()`:** Defines the boundary conditions for the simulation.
- **`analytical_solution()`:** Provides analytical solutions for comparison with simulation results.

## User Guide
